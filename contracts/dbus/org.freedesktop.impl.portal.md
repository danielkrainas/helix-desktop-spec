# XDG desktop portal backends — behavioral notes

Companion to the `org.freedesktop.impl.portal.*.xml` contracts, pinned
against xdg-desktop-portal 1.22.1. These are the *backend* interfaces: the
xdg-desktop-portal frontend calls them on behalf of applications.

## Registration

A backend owns a bus name and serves its interfaces at
`/org/freedesktop/portal/desktop`. It is advertised to the frontend with a
`<name>.portal` file in `$datadir/xdg-desktop-portal/portals/`:

```ini
[portal]
DBusName=<bus name>
Interfaces=<interface>;<interface>;
```

The frontend picks backends per interface from
`$datadir/xdg-desktop-portal/<desktop>-portals.conf`, where `<desktop>` is
each lowercased entry of `XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP` in order:

```ini
[preferred]
default=<backend>;<fallback>;
```

## Request (`org.freedesktop.impl.portal.Request`)

Methods that take a `handle` export a Request object at that path for the
duration of the interaction. The frontend calls `Close` to end it, after
which the object must be removed.

## Session (`org.freedesktop.impl.portal.Session`)

Methods that take a `session_handle` export a Session object at that path.
`Close` ends the session; `Closed` is emitted when the backend ends it.

## Settings

`ReadAll(namespaces)`: an empty list, or one containing an empty string,
matches all namespaces. An entry ending in `.*` matches namespaces with that
prefix. Otherwise matching is exact.

`Read(namespace, key)` fails for an unknown namespace or key. The frontend
expects the error `org.freedesktop.portal.Error.NotFound`.

`SettingChanged` is emitted whenever a value changes.

Documented keys, all in namespace `org.freedesktop.appearance`:

| Key | Type | Values |
|-----|------|--------|
| `color-scheme` | `u` | 0 no preference, 1 prefer dark, 2 prefer light |
| `accent-color` | `(ddd)` | sRGB in [0, 1]; out of range means unset |
| `contrast` | `u` | 0 no preference, 1 higher contrast |
| `reduced-motion` | `u` | 0 no preference, 1 reduced motion |

Unknown values are treated as 0. Backends may expose other namespaces; they
are undocumented (see `gaps.md`).

## Inhibit

`Inhibit(handle, app_id, window, flags, options)` inhibits until `Close` is
called on the Request at `handle`. Flags: 1 logout, 2 user switch, 4 suspend,
8 idle — the same bits as `org.gnome.SessionManager` inhibitors.
`options["reason"]` (`s`) is a user-visible reason.

`CreateMonitor` exports a Session at `session_handle`, returns `0` on success,
and sends `StateChanged(session_handle, state)` while the session is open.
`state` keys:

| Key | Type | Values |
|-----|------|--------|
| `screensaver-active` | `b` | whether the screensaver is active |
| `session-state` | `u` | 1 running, 2 query end, 3 ending |

On `session-state` 2, monitors must call `QueryEndResponse(session_handle)`
within one second.
